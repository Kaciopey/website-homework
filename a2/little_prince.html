			<p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, 
			I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.<t-under> I felt deeply moved and stirred.
			It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</t-under>
			<span class="highlight-orange"> It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> In the moonlight, I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, 
			his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:<f-color> "What I see here is nothing but a shell. 
			What is most important is invisible..." </f-color> As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, 
			I said to myself, again:<f-color> "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, 
			is his loyalty to a flowerâ€”the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, 
			even when he is asleep..."</f-color> And I felt him to be more fragile still. 
			<t-under>I felt the need of protecting him as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind</t-under>.</p>
